# Simple Horizon dashboard

Horizon, the OpenStack web user interface, allows developers to integrate new components in it. The dashboard stored in this repository represents a simple extension to Horizon, which itself is based on Django.
This dashboard allows a user to create and schedule backup jobs orchestrated by Mistral. Therefore this dashboard works only if integrated within Horizon.

In the next days I will write the instructions to setup the whole infrastructure, which requires and Docker, and make it run.
